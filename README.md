# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this project, historical usage patterns are combined with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand.
